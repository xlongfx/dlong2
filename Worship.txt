Receive our praise oh Lord
Receive our praise oh lord
Glory and honor we give unto u
Receive our praise oh lord

I praise You, I praise You …..oh Lord
I praise You, I praise You …..oh Lord (2ce)
In my life, I see what You’re doing
One more time
I lift my hands in praise
Of Your name
I lift my hands in praise
Of Your name…..
