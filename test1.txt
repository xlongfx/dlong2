Father I thank you for the gift of your Son, Jesus and I declare that I have the spirit of Sonship and I have
what I say. (Rom 8:15).
I am righteous and I am holy, I declare that I have the precious faith of Jesus and it produces results for
me daily. I have received abundance of Grace and I reign on earth. (Eph 4:24) (Rom 5:17).
I declare that I study God’s word daily, I fellowship with the Holy Spirit and I am always led by him. I
desire the sincere milk of God’s word always and I will grow by it. I am spiritual and I am not body ruled
or carnal. I always speak the right words and my words are gracious and seasoned with salt such that the
hearer is always edified. (Col4:6) (Rom 8:14) (1 Cor 3:3).
I declare that I have the right association and relationships that aid my spiritual growth and I don’t keep
ungodly company. I am passionate towards God and his kingdom, I am not slothful in business but
always fervent in the spirit, I am consistent and stable, and I am a faithful steward. Lines are falling unto
me in pleasant places and I have a goodly heritage. (Psalm 1:1), (Rom 12:11).
