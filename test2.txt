Confession to Start My Day
I declare that this is the best day of my life. As soon as my feet hit the floor after getting out of
my bed I thank You that Your angels are being dispatched to bring to my possession the
promises that Jesus holds in His hands. I thank You, Lord that there is a presence of You upon
my life today that I will not ignore. Instead, I will acknowledge the presence of the Holy Spirit in
all I set my hand to do. I thank You today for prosperity, promotion, and Your loving kindness,
grace, and mercy. I declare that yesterday's "no" becomes today's "yes." I thank You that You are
perfecting things concerning me and no good thing will You withhold from me because I have
decided to walk upright. I thank You that this is the best day of my life and tomorrow will be
better than today
