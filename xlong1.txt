I declare that I am conscious of God’s agenda for my life and I live a life of focus in the center of God’s
will for my life. I have been called with a holy calling and I place great value on the call. I do not choose
or carve my own path but I follow and pursue God's purpose, His pre-determined agenda. (2 Tim 1:9)
I am anointed and called to a specific assignment, and lines are falling unto me in pleasant places, so
every step I take is towards the fulfillment of Gods purpose. I am conscious of God’s grace upon my life
and I position myself appropriately such that I take full advantage of it. (Psalm 16:6)
